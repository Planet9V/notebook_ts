## 📐 Purdue Model Mapping

Control levels are logically aligned with the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) to isolate process control boundaries from enterprise systems:

## 🛡️ Control Matrix

| Standard Code | Question Text | Category | Purdue Level | Guidance / Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **CIP010-CIP-010-R1.1** | Are baseline configurations documented and approved for all cyber assets? | Configuration Management | 3 | Verify baseline configuration files, check logical profiles, and review software inventories.  SOP: 1. Deploy endpoint protection agents configured with real-time process monitoring to block unsigned scripts and execution threats. 2. Enforce automatic session logout GPOs terminating interactive operator connections after a defined period of inactivity. 3. Configure system event log forwarding to stream all reboots, login attempts, and administrative modifications to a centralized syslog receiver. 4. Format NERC CIP compliance logs and evidence packages to support regional auditor sweeps.  VERIFICATION CRITERIA: Inspect the configuration management configurations, check the verified logs, review the system settings, and check the following: Auditor evidence must include: NERC CIP compliance register, active reliability coordinator approval logs, Bulk Electric System (BES) cyber asset inventories, and WECC/SERC/RFC audit-ready evidence package files.  OT/IT CONVERGENCE RISK: General IT-OT convergence increases the threat landscape by bridging air-gapped industrial facilities with internet-facing corporate systems. Failing to enforce strict regulatory controls risks introducing severe operational vulnerabilities. |
| **CIP010-CIP-010-R1.2** | Do baselines catalog software versions, logical port settings, and running services? | Configuration Management | 3 | Audit baseline catalog sheets, serial numbers, port rosters, and software registers.  SOP: 1. Deploy endpoint protection agents configured with real-time process monitoring to block unsigned scripts and execution threats. 2. Enforce automatic session logout GPOs terminating interactive operator connections after a defined period of inactivity. 3. Configure system event log forwarding to stream all reboots, login attempts, and administrative modifications to a centralized syslog receiver. 4.

Failing to enforce strict regulatory controls risks introducing severe operational vulnerabilities. |
| **CIP010-CIP-010-R2.1** | Do configuration changes undergo security impact analysis prior to deployment? | Change Security Control | 3 | Verify change request documents, risk evaluation reports, and supervisor sign-offs.  SOP: 1. Deploy endpoint protection agents configured with real-time process monitoring to block unsigned scripts and execution threats. 2. Enforce automatic session logout GPOs terminating interactive operator connections after a defined period of inactivity. 3. Configure system event log forwarding to stream all reboots, login attempts, and administrative modifications to a centralized syslog receiver. 4.

## 🛠️ Verification & Implementation Guidelines

To implement the **NERC CIP-010-4** controls successfully inside your OT environment:

1. **Logical Separation**: Isolate all Level 1 and 2 process loops (PLCs/RTUs) from business segments using strict Level 3.5 DMZ routing tables.
2. **Access Control**: Ensure that all administrative commands to control loops require multi-factor authentication (MFA) via Jump Hosts.
3. **Continuous Auditing**: Collect and route event logs continuously to a write-once secure syslog receiver with synchronized NTP timestamps.
4. **Logic Backups**: Back up all running PLC configurations and logic programs weekly, storing them in fireproof cabinets or secure offsite enclaves.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any modifications to logic settings or firmware on Level 1-2 devices must undergo rigorous sandbox testing and double-signature verification before deployment.
